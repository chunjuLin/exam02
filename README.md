First of all we have to record the data from the accelerator. For the one that we have to find the gesture mode 
is pretty similar to the original mbed08. We use the ML to juged what is the gesture we have done. However, we still 
have to see if the data is over the angle. First of all, at the begin of the main.  I collected the horizontal data.
After collecting the horizontal data, we start multiple thread to do each job such as find the gesture and feature.
